            "explanation": "The statement does not indicate, whether the results would be different in the samples and from arid and semi-arid region. Hence, (a) does not weaken the argument. It is not known whether any samples taken for study include Indians nor does the passage give information regarding the vulnerability of Indians to cancer. Hence, (b) does not weaken the argument. From the passage it cannot be known whether the persons considered for this study drank similar type of coffee or different types coffee. Hence, (c) does not weaken the argument. The passage states that coffee does not after a person's vulnerability to cancer. While the statement says that milk offsets the negative effects of coffee. It also states that these studies did not consider this fact. It is possible that the negative effect of coffee is not evident because theses people consume milk. Choice (d) weakens the argument.",
