Input: when you 22 special 31  16  47 town. Which of the following steps will be the last but one?",
			"explanation": "The logic is: the words get arranged in alphabetical order. Where as the numbers get arranged in descending order. Numbers occupy odd places in the final steps while words occupy even positions. When any element gets arranged, the previous element occupying that position shifts one place towards right.
Here we have to find out the penultimate second step.
Input: when you 22 special 31  16  47 town

Ajay was to attend the batch at 4 p.m. on a day with a pass code 'sentence awarded by high court was executed'. However, he was completed to work in the batch 12 noon on that day. What was his pass code then??",
			"explanation": "Here it is a case of shifting, And is a case of two-step shifting, i.e. the logic consists of two steps.

This implies that the change from Batch II to Batch III is same as Input to Batch I.
Therefore, the changes from Batch I to Batch II, Batch III to Batch IV and Batch V to Batch VI will be the same.
Look at the changes from Input to Batch I; and from Batch I to Batch II.
P. If input is           1 2 3 4 5 6 7
Batch I becomes   1 7 2 6 3 5 4
Q. And if Batch is   1 2 3 4 5 6 7
Batch II becomes as follows: 7 1 6 2 5 3 4
Using the above two-step logic. Let us make a chart.
