But it was not always so. Among the initial stalwarts in the Indian planning process there were only a handful of economists. It was their political conviction and their preconceived political pattern of creating an economy and a society which gave them the specific stability in the path of development. Under the leadership of Indira Gandhi there was some change in the scenario and the reflection of electoral manifesto of the Congress Party was continually enhanced in the plans.",
