It is estimated that one billion of the world's poorest people in about 30 heavily deforested countries would be alleviated from poverty if they are given government support for managing neighbouring public forest land and sharing benefits with in their communities.The forests face even shakier future with the global population expected to grow by 50 percent in the next 50 years. To accommodate a growing population's need of more land for food production we should be making better use of the degraded land through 'Evergreen Revolution'<br> The growth of population is positively linked with growth of forests..",
			"explanation": "Positively here means 'definitely'. Now, such a link between population and forests certainly exists. Why else would the forests face 'shakier future' if population grew?",

While more than 28 million people in India suffer from low vision in our country, many people do not realize that they have this problem.<br> Low vision people are neither blind nor do they have full vision. Technically speaking, they score less than 6/18 on visual acuity, and their field of vision is restricted to 10 degrees or less. The people who cannot see very well but whose vision is not helped by the normal glasses are often those suffering from low vision.<br> It is possible to detect cases of low vision by using scientific techniques.
