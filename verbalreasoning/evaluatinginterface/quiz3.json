Hence, 2 is a conclusion.<br>For 3: In the statement, there is no reference to intension of the railway authority. Hence, 3 is out of context.<br>For 4: As the number of accidents is increasing in the past one year, it can be inferred that, the  frequency of trains did not increase in accordance to the increase in the number of commuters.
