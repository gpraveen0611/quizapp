According to the parents, the foetus had been detected to have serious disabilities which would affect the quality of life of the child if born. The court denied them permission, giving its own logic underlining the unborn baby’s right to live despite disabilities. Fortunately or unfortunately, the issue was resolved in a different way when the mother suffered a miscarriage a little later and lost the baby.<br> Globally, in a landmark case, a British teenage girl won the right to die the way she wants. Terminally ill Hanah Jones, just 13 years old, has spent much of the past eight years in hospital wards undergoing treatment for leukaemia. Euthanasia is complex because the issue is attached to ending life, voluntarily. Surprisingly, today it has been legalised only in a handful of countries. But here too and elsewhere the many forms of euthanasia have been taken into consideration. <br> The Mumbai couple approached the court because the courts have the authority to sanction euthanasia. Hence, the inference is definitely true? ",
