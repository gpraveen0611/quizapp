			"explanation": "The nuclear-haves [countries possessing nuclear weapons] raised certain facts after the Indian explosions. These explosions also gave Indians a sense of pride. This does not imply that the nuclear-haves would never have realised the facts otherwise. The meaning of the phrase 'sense of pride' used in the statement is different from the meaning of 'proud people' used in assumption (I). Neither (I) nor (II) is an assumption..",
