This is the only way to reduce the risk of exposing people to some diseases.<br>II.No. Each individual should have right to choose what he wants.<br>III.No. There is no confirmed evidence that such products have adverse effects on human body.<br>IV.Yes. It is banned in many other countries also.",
			"explanation": "The use of 'only' in I makes it invalid. Also, it is the duty of the government to save its citizens from intake of any harmful products, even if they like them. So, II does not hold strong. Besides, a product must not be banned unless its harmful effects have been proved. So, III holds strong. Lastly, we cannot blindly follow the decisions taken by other countries. So, IV also does not hold.",

Clearly, both I and II hold strong, as they provide very convincing reasons, for a single tax system would help get rid of multifarious taxes on a product.

			"explanation": "The use of the word 'only' in argument I makes it weak. To bring uniformity in educational standards, we can have many universities all following same curricular and policies under one Board. Also, having one university will make the management of education throughout the country almost impossible. So, argument II holds. Besides, it is the variation in the syllabi and assessment of different universities that makes their degrees incomparable, when the students from these universities come together to compete for a job on a common platform.

It is the present management theory.<br>II.No. Many workers are illiterate and so their contributions will not be of any value.<br>III.Yes. Employees-owned companies generally have higher productivity.<br>IV.No. Employee-union ownership drives up salaries and wages.",
			"explanation": "Argument I in support does not provide a valid reason for the pursuance of the policy. So, it is vague. Argument II provides a valid reason, as literacy is an essential criteria to take proper decisions on policy matters regarding management of factories. Besides, workers, if involved in management, would surely be motivated to work more devotedly, thus enhancing productivity. So, both II and III follow. IV provides a reason too feeble in the light of facts given in II and III. So, IV also does not hold strong.",
