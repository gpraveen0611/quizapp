			"explanation": "Although choices a and c both describe suspensions, only choice c describes a suspension that is the result of one of the two scenarios given in the definition of a five-day suspension (physical assault or destructing or defacing school property). Therefore, we can assume that Franny’s suspension, which is the result of spray painting school property, will be a five day suspension. Since the definition doesn’t provide any information about suspensions for cheating, we can assume that Lillian’s suspension does not fall into the five-day suspension category.",
