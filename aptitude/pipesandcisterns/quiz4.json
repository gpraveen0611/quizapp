			"explanation": "Let the total capacity of tank be 90 liters.<br> Capacity of tank filled in 1 minute by K = 3 liters. <br> Capacity of tank filled in 1 minute by L = 15 liters.<br>Therefore, capacity of the tank filled by both K and L in 1 minute = 18 liters.<br> Hence, time taken by both the pipes to overflow the tank = 90/18 = 5 minutes.
