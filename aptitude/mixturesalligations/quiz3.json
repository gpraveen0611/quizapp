(1)<br>Since after mixing the two solutions the new mixture has 94% purity,<br>Concentrate of A + Concentrate of B = Concentrate of (A + B)<br>A x 90% + B x 94% = (A+ B) x 97%<br>A x 90/100 + B x 97/100 = (A + B) x 94/100<br>90A + 97B = (A + B) x 94<br>90A + 97B = 94A + 94B<br>94A + 94B - 90A- 97B = 0<br>4A - 3B = 0 ........................(2)<br>Multiply the 3 with Equation (1) and add with Equation (2),<br>3A + 3B + 4A - 3B = 63 + 0<br>7A = 63<br>A = 63/7 = 9<br>Put the value of A in Equation (1) , we will get<br>9 + B = 21<br>B = 21 - 9<br>B = 12<br>The first solution would be A = 9 liters.",
