            "name": "A 20 litre mixture of milk and water contains milk and water in the ratio 3 : 2. 10 litres of the mixture is removed and replaced with pure milk and the operation is repeated once more. At the end of the two removals and replacement, what is the ratio of milk and water in the resultant mixture?",
			"explanation": "The 20 litre mixture contains milk and water in the ratio of 3 : 2. Therefore, there will be 12 litres of milk in the mixture and 8 litres of water in the mixture.<br>Step 1. When 10 litres of the mixture is removed, 6 litres of milk is removed and 4 litres of water is removed. Therefore, there will be 6 litres of milk and 4 litres of water left in the<br>container. It is then replaced with pure milk of 10 litres. Now the container will have 16 litres of milk and 4 litres of water.<br>Step 2. When 10 litres of the new mixture is removed, 8 litres of milk and 2 litres of water is removed. The container will have 8 litres of milk and 2 litres of water in it. Now 10 litres of<br>pure milk is added. Therefore, the container will have 18 litres of milk and 2 litres of water in it at the end of the second step.<br>Therefore, the ratio of milk and water is 18 : 2 or 9 : 1.",

			"explanation": "ln a mixture of 1,000 ml sodium carbonate : benzene Solution = 3 : 1.<br>Hence, sodium carbonate: 750 ml benzene Solution 250 ml<br>A 250 ml of 3: 2 Solution contains 150 ml sodium carbonate Solution and l00ml benzene Solution.<br>Total sodium carbonate Solution = 900 ml, total benzene Solution = 350 ml<br>After using 250 ml to make strong organic Solution , sodium carbonate Solution used = 250/1250 x 900 = 180 ml<br>pure sodium carbonate Solution left = 900 -180 =720ml",
