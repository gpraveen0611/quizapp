They both run at their earlier speeds. Which of the following is true in connection with the second race?",
			"explanation": "In a 100 meters race, when Karan runs 100 meters, Arjun runs 90 meters. Since time is constant, the ratio of distances is equal to the ratio of speeds. So, the ratio of speeds of Karan and Arjun is 100:90 = 10:9. In the second case, Karan will have to run 110 meters to complete the race. In this case, the ratio of distances travelled will be equal to the ratio of speeds 10:9. So, when Karan runs 110 meters, Arjun will run (110 x 9)/10 = 99 meters, i.e., he needs to cover 1 meter to complete the race. In other words, Karan beats Arjun by 1 meter.",
