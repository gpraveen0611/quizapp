",
			"explanation": "The first sentence says that women's boxing has not been recognized as an Olympic sport. Sentence A follows with the idea that the IBA is campaigning towards including it in the 2008 Olympics. Taking up boxing as a profession or getting a government job as mentioned in sentences B and C cannot be a great 'dream' to be fulfilled which is the idea stated in the last sentence.",
